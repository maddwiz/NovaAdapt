# Licensing

## Current Repository License

NovaAdapt in this repository is released under the MIT License (`/LICENSE`).

## Enterprise Dual-Licensing Plan

To keep licensing predictable:

- The code in this repo remains MIT.
- If enterprise-only capabilities are introduced (for example hosted control-plane services, closed plugins, or managed memory/safety products), they should ship as separate packages/services under a commercial agreement.
- Community contributors to this repo continue to contribute under MIT terms.

This keeps the open core permissive while allowing separately distributed enterprise offerings when needed.
